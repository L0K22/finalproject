   <h1 class= "nolanws"> Nolan Ryan Wolrd Series </h1>
   <p> One of the best memories of my short teenaged life must be the winning the Nolan Ryan World Series, and simply my entire 
     All Star career at Hollenbeck Park. It first started in a pre-season tourney on Independence Day. This was our first weekend
      together, first of many. We gelled quickly, and are already as close as brothers. We breeze through our first two games, 
      mercying overrated travelball teams. Next we play ourselves for the championship. We were the 13 year old team, and we were
      squaring off againts our older version of our all star team. The game is close and tense and we end up beating our older 
      rivals by one run. Little did we know, people were scouting our team, and it was a quialifyer for a World Series. After 
      placing top 4 in califonia, we went onto a post season. The Nolan Ryan World Series. We fight hard, and win the World 
      Series. I win the Silver Slugger award, an award presented to the best slugger in the tournament, as well as a championship
      ring. </p>

   <h1 class="posths"> Post Highscool Goals </h1>
   <p>
      I am currently attending Covina High School, and I am already setting myself up for degrees in college. I am paying close 
      attention to the classes I am currently taking, and what classes I will take to finish up my years at Covina. Hopefully, 
      I will make the right decisions in classes in order to improve my chances in attending a university, or high accidemic 
      college. I plan on attending a UC, or a decent Devision 1 baseball school. My dream college would either be Vanderbilt, 
      Cal State fullerton, or even UCSD. I plan on majoring in Kineseology, whch is the study of sports and bodily movements,
      minor in Engineering.

   <h1 class="career"> Post College/Career </h1>
   <p> Whilst using my minor and majors, I hope to persue a career in sports. I hope to follow in my brothers footsteps and
      become a coach. My brother is the oldest of my half siblings, and is the assistant coach at Pomona-Pitzer College. I hope
      to do the same and become a college assistant, or even head coach. I feel this career coice would be suitable for me, 
      mainly due to the fact I already know so much fundementals and advanced technique in both baseball and basketball. I help
      out my less experienced teammates in order to make my team better and overall the entire program of the sport better.
      Say this dosen't work out, I have my engineering degree which will be very helpful in the new world. The new world filled 
      with high competition and vastly reliable in technolgy. Over all, however the dice ends up rolling, I hope to impact other 
      peoples lives and make the world a better place </p>
