   <h1 class= "nolanws"> Nolan Ryan Wolrd Series </h1>
   <p> One of the best memories of my short teenaged life must be the winning the Nolan Ryan World Series, and simply my entire 
     All Star career at Hollenbeck Park. It first started in a pre-season tourney on Independence Day. This was our first weekend
      together, first of many. We gelled quickly, and are already as close as brothers. We breeze through our first two games, 
      mercying overrated travelball teams. Next we play ourselves for the championship. We were the 13 year old team, and we were
      squaring off againts our older version of our all star team. The game is close and tense and we end up beating our older 
      rivals by one run. Little did we know, people were scouting our team, and it was a quialifyer for a World Series. After 
      placing top 4 in califonia, we went onto a post season. The Nolan Ryan World Series. We fight hard, and win the World 
      Series. I win the Silver Slugger award, an award presented to the best slugger in the tournament, as well as a championship
      ring. </p>
