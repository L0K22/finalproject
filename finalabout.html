<h1 class="hdodger"> DODGERS </h1>
<p class="pdodger"> Without a doubt, I am a huge baseball fan, and a huge fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers. I have been a fan ever since I can
remember. In fact, one of my earliest memories was bonding with my 9-year old little league team, sitting in the reserve level down by right
field. It seemed so far away, did home plate. The field seemed to never end, the possibilities were endless. The little kid of me looked upon 
the baseball diamond with gleaming eyes, simply dreaming of playing on that field one day.</p>

<h1> Who am I?</h1>
<p>First off my name is Tyler Scott Lokar. My parents knew my middle name long before my first day on this Earth. Scott comes from my uncle (my
mothers brother), Scott Roberson, who fought cancer and fortunately emerged victorious. My first name was decided simply due to the fact that it
flowed well as a whole. From an early age I was hanging around adults, which allowed me to mature at an early age. Ironically I am still a mirror
of that immature little boy I once was. My mother and I are very immature, and we crack immature, silly, and borderline inappropriate jokes with
eachother. Both of my parents work part time. My Mom works as an instructional aid as Las Palmas MS. She loves working with special needs 
children. My father is a public speaker, and essentially "coaches coaches". He works for PCA, Positive Coaching Allience, and the companies
commercial was even in the super bowl! I love my siblings, I have one brother who coaches at Pomona Pitzer College, and two sisters. <p>
