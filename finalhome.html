  <p> Hello world. This website will be covering an Ethical Dilemma (page 3 on the nav bar), talking about myself 
  and my life (page 2/ABOUT), and about why I enjoy Exploring CS(page 1/HOME)</p>

<p> This website is made for Exploring Computer Science, taught by Mr.Platt at Covina High. Attending this class comes with
a funny story. When enrolling for High School in August of 2016, I was handed my class schedule. On this schedule it contained a 
class called Gen Tech in first period. My father accompanied me to the counselors office, because we had to switch me out of Chinese
and into another language class, such as Spanish or ASL. Whilst speaking with the counselor, my father asks, "Now what the heck is 
'General Technology' anyways?" The counselor responds, "No sir, that is 'Generational Technology.' They're going to be playing with drones
and other types of technology of the current generation." Me and my dad simply smile and nod, while on the inside we are screaming with
joy at the top of our lungs. I think, 'Oh my god, this class will be so much fun, and a great start to the day,' and it is. I enjoy just 
about every minute of this class, and sets me up to have a great day.</p>

<h1 class="siderhead"> Would I recommend ECS? </h1>
<p> Expoloring Computer science is and intensely personal decision. I started off with a great insite into what ECS would be, but for other
people this might not be your class. However, this can lead to a great first period for the year. The world now is simply survival of the 
fittest. Colleges accept the strongest individuals, and with a few years of Computer Science or GenTech, can give you an edge over the next 
person in line. It's now up to you.</p>
